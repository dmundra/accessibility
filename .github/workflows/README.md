# Workflows

## pa11y.yml

Tests the site for accessibility issues using pa11y-ci. The results of the tests are shown in HTML that has to be
downloaded from GitHub under 'Artifacts' and viewed locally.

The commands can also be run locally to generate the same test results:

* `npm run start-detached` this will start the local server in a detached state.
* `npm run pa11y-ci:home` run pa11y-ci against the home page.
* `npm run pa11y-ci:sitemap` run pa11y-ci against all URLs generated by the sitemap except for PDFs. This command throws
  the error 'Error: Process completed with exit code 2.' when there are accessibility issues detected.
* `npm run pa11y-ci:output` save the pa11y-ci output in a readable HTML format.
